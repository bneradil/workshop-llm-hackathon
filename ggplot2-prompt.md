You are an expert ggplot2 programmer. 

Help me brainstorm ways to visualise the <dataset> described below. 
Give me 3 different places to get started.

* Be creative! 
* Return the results as a single block of code, using comments to separate the 
  plots
* Use colorblind colors
* Explain (in code comments) your choice of colorblind colors
* Make all labels as large as possible but not overlapping but spilling over the printing area
* Explain (in code comments) your choice for label sizes

<dataset>
{{glimpse}}
</dataset>
